# Software Engineering Fields

[](#software-engineering-fields)

- Front End Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back End Development: SQL, Git, Linux, and Web Servers
- Scientific Computing: Python and its many libraries

These are all mature, 20+ year old technologies. Whichever company you work for, you will almost certainly use most of these tools.
The best way to learn these tools is to build projects. Try to code at least some every day.

## Chapter 1: Learning to Code

[](#learning-to-code)

I started googling questions like "how to automatically click through websites." And "how to import data from websites into Excel."

I didn't realize it at the time, but I was learning how to automate workflows.

It was the work of an amateur. What developers might call a "dirty hack". But it got the job done.

"If you work for 10 years, do you get 10 years of experience or do you get 1 year of experience 10 times? You have to reflect on your activities to get true experience. If you make learning a continuous commitment, you’ll get experience. If you don’t, you won’t, no matter how many years you have under your belt." – Steve McConnell, Software Engineer

And this is precisely where I found myself a few weeks into learning to code.

I had read the first 100 pages of several programming books, but finished none.

I had written the first 100 lines of code from several programming tutorials, but finished none.

I didn't know it, but I was trapped in place that developers lovingly call "tutorial hell."

**Nobody Can Make You a Developer But You**
"I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it." – **_Morpheus in the 1999 film The Matrix_**

### Why is learning to code still so hard after all these years?

There are three big reasons why learning to code is so hard, even today:

1. The tools are still primitive.
2. Most people aren't good at handling ambiguity, and learning to code is ambiguous. People get lost.
3. Most people aren't good at handling constant negative feedback. And learning to code is one brutal error message after another. People get frustrated.

### Learning to Code is an Ambiguous Process

When you're learning to code, you constantly ask yourself: "Am I spending my time wisely? Am I learning the right tools? Do these book authors / course creators even know what they're talking about?"

Ambiguity fogs your every study session. "Did my test case fail because the tutorial is out of date, and there have been breaking changes to the framework I'm using? Or am I just doing it wrong?"

### How Not to Get Lost When Learning to Code

The good news is: both competence and confidence come with practice.

Soon you'll know exactly what to google. You'll get a second sense for how documentation is usually structured, and where to look for what. And you'll know where to ask which questions.

**_People think software development is about typing code into a computer. But it's really about learning._**

Get comfortable with ambiguity and you will go far.

### Learning to Code is One Error Message After Another

A lot of people who are learning to code feel like they hit a wall. Progress does not come as fast as they expect.

Most of the time your code will crash.

If you're lucky, you'll get an error message.

Imagine if every time you handed your teacher your term paper, they handed it back with big red "F" written on it. And imagine they did this before you could even blink. Over and over.

That's what coding can feel like sometimes. You want to grab the computer and shout at it, "why don't you just understand what I'm trying to do?" :)

### How Not to Get Frustrated

The key, again, is practice.

Over time, you will develop a tolerance for vague error messages and screen-length stack traces.

Coding will never be harder than it is when you're just starting out

1. **Tip #1: Know that you are not uniquely bad at this.**
   Everyone who learns to code struggles with the frustration of trying to Vulcan Mind Meld with a computer, and get it to understand you. (That's another Star Trek reference.)

2. **Tip #2: Breathe.**
   Many people's natural reaction when they get an error message is to gnash their teeth. Then go back into their code editor and start blindly changing code, hoping to somehow luck into getting past it.

   This does not work. And I'll tell you why.

   The universe is complex. Software is complex. You are unlikely to just Forest Gump your way into anything good.

   Even if you somehow do get lucky, and get past the bug, what will you have learned?

   So instead of thrashing, you want to take some time. Understand the code. Understand what's happening. And then fix the error.

3) **Tip #3: Use Rubber Duck Debugging**
   Get a rubber ducky and set it next to your computer. Every time you hit an error message, try to explain what you think is happening to your rubber duck.
   Of course, this is silly. How could this possibly be helpful?
   Except it is.
   Rubber Duck Debugging is a great tool for slowing down and talking through the problem at hand.

### How do Most People Learn to Code?

Now let's talk about traditional pathways to a first developer job.

Why should you care what everyone else does? Spoiler alert: you don't really need to.

**_You do you._**

This said, you may doubt yourself and the decisions you've made about your learning. You may yearn for the path not taken.

My goal with this section is to calm any anxieties you may have.

### The Importance of computer science degrees

"Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter." – Eric Raymond, Developer, Computer Scientist, and Author

As of writing this, Computer Science is the highest paying degree you can get. Higher even than fields focused on money, such as Finance and Economics.

**Do You Need a University Degree to Work as a Software Developer?**
No. There are plenty of employers who will hire you without a bachelor's degree.

A bachelor's degree will make it much easier to get an interview at a lot of employers. And it may also help you command a higher salary.

**_The fact is: life is fundamentally unfair. But that does not change how the labor market works._**

You can choose easy mode, and finish a degree that will give you more options down the road.

Or you can go hard mode, potentially save time and money, and just be more selective about which employers you apply to.

I have plenty of friends who've used both approaches to great success.

### How to Teach Yourself to Code

Most developers are self-taught. Even the developers who earned a Bachelor's of computer science still often report themselves as "self-taught" on industry surveys like Stack Overflow's annual survey.

This is because learning to code is a life-long process. There are constantly new tools to learn, new legacy codebases to map out, and new problems to solve.

**_So whether you pursue formal education or not, know this: you will need to get good at self-teaching._**

### What Does it Mean to be a "Self-Taught" Developer?

Not to be pedantic, but when I refer to self-teaching, I mean self-directed learning – learning outside of formal education.

Very few people are truly "self-taught" at anything. For example, Isaac Newton taught himself Calculus because there were no Calculus books. He had to figure it out and invent it as he went along.

Someone might tell you: "You're not really self taught because you learned from books or online courses. So you had teachers." And they are correct, but only in the most narrow sense.

If someone takes issue with you calling yourself self-taught, just say: "By your standards, no one who wasn't raised by wolves can claim to be self-taught at anything."

### What is Self-Directed Learning?

As a self-learner, you are going to curate your own learning resources. You're going to choose what to learn, from where. That is the essence of "Self-Directed Learning."

But how do you know you're learning the right skills, and leveraging the right resources?

Well, that's where community comes in.

### What Programming Language should i learn first

The short answer is: it doesn't really matter. Once you've learned one programming language well, it is much easier to learn your second language.

There are different types of programming languages, but today most development is done using "high-level scripting languages" like JavaScript and Python. These languages trade away the raw efficiency you get from "low-level programming languages" like C. What they get in return: the benefit of being much easier to use.

**_"Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript." – Atwood's Law (Jeff Atwood, founder of Stack Overflow and Discourse)_**

But the key skills you should spend 90% of your pre-job learning time on are:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Linux
- Git
- SQL
- Node.js
- Express.js

### Where do I learn how to code?

Funny you should ask. There's a full curriculum designed by experienced software engineers and teachers. It's designed with busy adults in mind. And it's completely free and self-paced.

That's right. I'm talking about the freeCodeCamp core curriculum. It will help you learn:

- Front End Development
- Back End Development
- Engineering Mathematics
- and Scientific Computing (with Python for Data Science and Machine Learning)

To date, thousands of people have gone through this core curriculum and gotten a developer job. They didn't need to quit their day job, take out loans, or really risk anything other than some of their nights and weekends.

### Building Your Skills is a Life-Long Endeavor

We've talked about why self-teaching is probably the best way to go, and how to go about it.

We've talked about the alternatives to self-teaching, such as getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, or getting a Master's degree.

And we've talked about which specific tools you should focus on learning first.

## Chapter 2: How to Build Your Network

[](#how-to-build-your-network)

"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." – African Proverb

"Networking." You may wince at the sound of that word.

Networking may bring to mind awkward job fairs in stuffy suits, desperately pushing your résumé into the hands of anyone who will accept it.

Networking may bring to mind alcohol-drenched watch parties – where you pretend to be interested in a sport you don't even follow.

Networking may bring to mind wishing "happy birthday" to people you barely know on LinkedIn, or liking their status updates hoping they'll notice you.

### How to Build Your Reputation as a Developer

There are at least six time-tested ways you can build your reputation as a developer. These are:

1. [Hackathons](#how-to-find-hackathons-and-other-developer-competitions)
2. [Contributing to open source](#how-to-contribute-to-open-source)
3. [Creating Developer-focused content](#how-to-create-developer-focused-content)
4. [Rising in the ranks working at companies who have a "household name"](#how-to-rise-in-the-ranks-by-working-at-big-companies)
5. [Building a portfolio of freelance clients](#how-to-build-your-reputation-by-building-a-portfolio-of-freelance-clients)

6. [Starting your own open source project, company, or charity](#how-to-start-your-own-open-source-project-company-or-charity)

### How to Rise in the Ranks by Working at Big Companies

You may have seen a developer introduced as an "Ex-Googler" or an "Ex-Netflix engineer."

Some tech companies have such rigorous hiring processes – and such high standards – that even getting a job at the company is a big accomplishment.

There are some practical reasons why employers look at where candidates have previously worked. It reduces the risk of a bad hire.

You can build up your reputation by working your way up the prestige hierarchy. You can ladder from a local employer to a Fortune 500 company, and ultimately to one of the big tech giants.

### How to Find Hackathons and Other Developer Competitions

[](#how-to-find-hackathons-and-other-developer-competitions)
Hackathons represent the most immediate way to build your reputation, your network, and your coding skills at the same time.

Most hackathons are free, and open to the public. You just need to have the time and the budget to travel.

If you live in a city with lots of hackathons – like San Francisco, New York, Bengaluru, or Beijing – you may be able to commute to the event, then go home and sleep in your own bed.

Hackathons used to be hard core events. People would knock back energy drinks and sleep on floors, all to finish their project by pitch time.

**_The best way to find upcoming events is to just google "hackathon [your city name]" and browse the various event calendars that come up in the search results. Many of these will be run by universities, local employers, or even education-focused charities._** yoooo!! this worked in realtime- i googled hackathon and saw [chainlink](https://chain.link/hackathon?&utm_medium=paid-search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=blockmagic-hackathon&utm_content=zfj6136h4g78&utm_term=1bv9p7mo8hjv&utm_term=hackathon&utm_campaign=FY23Q1_General_Spring+2023+Hackathon+-+Paid+Search_Conversion&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=8091600258&hsa_cam=21165424469&hsa_grp=163749992867&hsa_ad=695909119126&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-374421537&hsa_kw=hackathon&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_qexBhCoARIsAFgBlevkzD7vZA8Oa2IWKMAEAwFWz2GNocOS0XG5TGi_q5ReStrlcVqt6VkaAiApEALw_wcB) online

If you're playing to win, I recommend doing your research ahead of time.

### How to Contribute to Open Source

[](#how-to-contribute-to-open-source)

Contributing to open source is one of the most immediate ways you can build your reputation. Most employers are going to look at your GitHub profile, which will prominently display your Git commit history.

Many open source project maintainers, such as Linux Foundation, Mozilla (Firefox), and of course freeCodeCamp ourselves, have high standards for code quality.

You can read through open GitHub issues to find known bugs or feature requests. Then you can make the code changes and open a pull request. If the maintainers merge your pull request, this will be a major feather in your cap.

One of the best ways to get a job at a tech company is to become a prolific open source contributor to their repositories.

Open source contribution is a great way to build your reputation because everything you do is right out in public. And you get the social proof of having other developers review and accept your work.

### How to Create Developer-Focused Content

[](#how-to-create-developer-focused-content)
Developers are people. And like other people, they want something to do with their time when they're not working, sleeping, or hanging with friends and family.

For many people – including myself – that means spending time in other people's thoughts. Books. Video essays. Interactive experiences like visual novels.

You can broadly refer to these as "content." I'm not a huge fan of the word, because it makes these works feel disposable. But that's what people call it.

Software development is an incredibly broad field, with so many different topics you could approach. There are developer lifestyle vlogs, coding interview prep tutorials, coding live streams on Twitch, and developer interview podcasts like the freeCodeCamp Podcast.

### How to Rise in the Ranks by Working at Big Companies

[](#how-to-rise-in-the-ranks-by-working-at-big-companies)
You may have seen a developer introduced as an "Ex-Googler" or an "Ex-Netflix engineer."

Some tech companies have such rigorous hiring processes – and such high standards – that even getting a job at the company is a big accomplishment.

There are some practical reasons why employers look at where candidates have previously worked. It reduces the risk of a bad hire.

You can build up your reputation by working your way up the prestige hierarchy. You can ladder from a local employer to a Fortune 500 company, and ultimately to one of the big tech giants.

### How to Build your Reputation by Building a Portfolio of Freelance Clients

[](#how-to-build-your-reputation-by-building-a-portfolio-of-freelance-clients)
You can build your reputation by working with companies as a freelancer.

Freelance developers usually work on smaller one-person projects. So this may be a better strategy for building your reputation locally.

For example, if you did good work for a locally-based bank, that may be enough to convince a local law firm to contract you as well.

There is something to be said for being a "hometown hero." I know many developers who can effectively compete with online competition just by being physically present in meetings, and knowing people locally.

**How to Build a Developer Portfolio of Your Work**

Once you've built some projects, you'll want to show them off. And the best way to do this is with short videos.

People are busy. They don't have time to pull down your code and run it on their own computer.

And if you send people to a website, they may not fully grasp what they're looking at, and why it's so special.

That's why I recommend you use a screen capture tool to record 2 minute video demos.

You can put these project demo videos on websites like YouTube, Twitter, your GitHub profile, and of course your own portfolio website.

For capturing this video, I recommend using QuickTime, which comes built-in with MacOS. And if you're on Windows, you can use Game Recorder, which comes free in Windows 10.

### How to Start Your Own Open Source Project, Company, or Charity

[](#how-to-start-your-own-open-source-project-company-or-charity)

Being a founder is the fastest – but also riskiest – way to build a reputation as a developer.

It's riskiest because you're wagering your time, your money, and possibly even your personal relationships – all for an unknown outcome.

If you contribute to open source for long enough, you will build a reputation as a developer.

If you grind the hackathon circuit for long enough, you will build a reputation as a developer.

But you could attempt to start entrepreneurial projects for decades without getting traction. And squander your time, money, and connections along the way.

## Chapter 4: How to Get Paid to Code – Freelance Clients and the Job Search

[](#how-to-get-paid-to-code-–-freelance-clients-and-the-job-search)
If you've been building your skills, your network, and your reputation, then getting a developer job is not all that complicated.

### What Employers Want

Flash forward a decade. I have now been on both sides of the table. I've been interviewed by hiring managers as a developer. I've interviewed developers as a hiring manager.

**Most Employers are Risk Averse**
Let's say a manager hires the wrong developer. Take a moment to think about how bad that can be for the team.

On average, it takes about 3 months to fill a developer position at a company. Employers have to first:

- get the budget to hire a developer approved by their bosses
- create the job description
- post the job on job sites and communicate with recruiters
- sift through résumés – many of which will be low-effort from candidates who are blindly applying to as many jobs as possible
- start the interviewing process, which may involve flying the candidates out to the city and lodging them in a hotel
  rounds of interviews involving lots of team members. For some employers, this is a multi-day affair
- selecting a final candidate, and negotiating an offer...
- which many candidates will not accept anyway
- signing contracts and onboarding the employee
- giving them access to sensitive internal systems
- introducing them to their teammates, and making sure everyone gets along OK
- and then months of informal training, when the employee needs to understand a service or a part of a legacy codebase
- and finally, steeping them in the team's way of doing things
  In short – a lot of work.

**Because Employers are So Risk Averse, Job Seekers Suffer**
Now if you think hiring is hard, wait until you hear about the job application process. You may already be all-too-familiar with it. But here goes...

- You have to prepare your résumé or CV. Along the way, you will make decisions which you'll constantly second-guess throughout your job search.
- You have to look around for job openings online, research the employers, and assess whether they're likely to be a good fit for you.
- Most job openings will lead to webforms where you will have to retype your résumé over and over again, hoping the form doesn't crash due to server errors or JavaScript validation errors.
- Once you submit these job applications, you have to wait while employer process them. Some employers receive so many applications that they can't manually review them all. (Google alone receives 9,000 applications per day.) - Employers will use software to filter through applications. In-house recruiters spend an average of 6 seconds looking at each résumé. Often your application will never even be reviewed by a human.
- You will likely never hear anything back from the company. They have little incentive to tell you why they rejected you (they don't want you to file a discrimination lawsuit). If you're lucky, you'll get one of those "We've chosen to pursue other candidates" emails.
- And all the time you spend applying for these jobs – potentially hours per week – is mentally exhausting and, of course, unpaid.

Wow. So you can see what a nightmare the hiring process is for employers, and especially for job candidates.

But if you stick with it, you can eventually land offers. And when it rains, it pours.

**If you Build Your Skills, Your Network, and Your Reputation You Can Bypass a Lot of the Job Application Process.**

**_"Luck is preparation meeting opportunity. If you hadn't been prepared when the opportunity came along, you wouldn't have been 'lucky.'" – Oprah Winfrey_**

One big thing your interviewers are trying to establish: are you a cool-headed person who will play well with others? The best way to show this is to be polite, and refrain from using profanity or drifting too far off from the subject at hand.

## Chapter 5: How to Succeed in Your First Developer Job

**_"A ship in port is safe. But that's not what ships are built for." – Grace Hopper, Mathematician, US Navy Rear Admiral, and Computer Science Pioneer_**

Once you get your first developer job, that's when the real learning begins.

You'll learn how to work productively alongside other developers.

You'll learn how to navigate large legacy codebases.

You'll learn Version Control Systems, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery tools (CI/CD), project management tools, and more.

You'll learn how to work under an engineering manager. How to ship ahead of a deadline. And how to work through a great deal of ambiguity on the job.

Most importantly, you'll learn how to manage yourself.

You'll learn how to break through psychological barriers that affect all of us, such as imposter syndrome. You'll learn your limits, and how to push ever so slightly beyond them.

every time your opponent moves, slow down and try to understand the game from their perspective – why did they make that move?"

### If You Keep Having to Do a Task, You Should Automate it

Another lesson I learned about software development: since I was the most junior person on the team, I often got assigned the "grunt work" that nobody else wanted to do. One of these tasks was to be the "build nanny."

Because in practice, if a task can be automated – if you can break it down into discrete steps that a computer can reliably do for you – then you should probably automate it.

### Lessons from the Village Elders

He just let out a laugh and said, "Sure, when you started, you were the worst developer on the team. I'd say you're still the worst developer on the team."

I sat there smiling awkwardly, blinking at him, not sure whether he was just angry I was leaving.

And then he said, "But that's smart. You're smart. Because you always want to be the worst musician in the band. You always want to be surrounded by people who are better than you. That's how you grow."

### Lessons From my First Year as a Developer

I did a lot of things right during my first year as a professional developer. I give myself a B-.

But if I had the chance to do it all again, there are some things I'd do differently.

Here are some tips. May these maximize your learning and minimize your heartache.

#### Leave Your Ego at the Door

Many people entering the software development field will start at the very bottom. One title you might have is "Junior Developer."

It can feel a bit awkward to be middle aged and have the word "junior" in your title. But with some patience and some hard work, you can move past it.

One problem I faced every day was – I had 10 years of professional experience. I was not an entry-level employee. Yes, I was new to development, but I was quite experienced at teaching and even managing people. (I'd managed 30 employees at my most recent teaching job.)

And yet – in spite of all my past work experience – I was still an entry-level developer. I was still a novice. A neophyte. A newbie.

you need to accept all the emotions that come with being a beginner again. You need to focus on the task at hand and get the job done.

#### It's Probably Just the Imposter Syndrome Talking

Almost everyone I know has experienced Imposter Syndrome. That feeling that you do not belong. That feeling that at any moment your teammates are going to see how terrible your code is and expose you as not a "real developer."

To some extent, the feeling does not go away. It's always there in the back of your mind, ready to rear its head when you try to do something new.

"Could you help me get past this error message?" "Um... I'm not sure if I'm the best person to ask."

"Could you pair program with me on implementing this feature?" "Um... I guess if you can't find someone more qualified."

"Could you give a talk at our upcoming conference?" "Um... me?"

The key is to just accept it: "It's probably just the imposter syndrome talking."

And to keep going.

#### Find Your Tribe. But Don't Fall for Tribalism

When you get your first developer job, you'll work alongside other developers. Yipee – you found your tribe.

You'll spend a lot of time with them, and you all may start to feel like a tight unit.

But don't ignore the non-developer people around you.

In my story above, I talked about Mike, the Product Manager who also ran startup events. He was "non-technical". His knowledge of coding was limited at best. But I'd venture to say I learned as much from him as anyone else at the company.

You may work with other people from other departments – designers, product managers, project managers, IT people, QA people, marketers, even finance and accounting folks. You can learn a lot from these people, too.

Yes, you should focus on building strong connective tissue between you and the other devs on the team. But stay curious. Hang out with other people in the lunch room or at company events. You never know who's going to be the next person to help you build your skills, your network, or your reputation.

#### Don't Get Too Comfortable and Specialize too Early

I often give this advice to folks who are first starting their coding journey: "learn general coding skills (JavaScript, SQL, Linux, and so on) and then specialize on the job."

The idea is, once you understand how the most common tools work, you can the go and learn those tools' less common equivalents.

For example, once you've learned PostgreSQL, you can easily learn MySQL. Once you've learned Node.js, you can easily learn Ruby on Rails or Java Spring Boot.

But some people specialize too early at work. Their boss might ask them to "own" a certain API or feature. And if they do a good job with that, their boss may keep giving them similar projects.

Remember: your boss may be responsible for your performance at your job, but you are responsible for your performance across your career.

Take on projects that both fulfill your obligation to your employer, and also position you well for your long-term career goals.

## Epilogue: You Can Do This

If there's one message I want to leave you with here, it is this: you can do this.

You can learn these concepts.

You can learn these tools.

You can become a developer.

Then, the moment someone hands you money for you to help them code something, you will graduate to being a professional developer.

Learning to code and getting a first developer job is a daunting process. But do not be daunted.

If you stick with it, you will eventually succeed. It is just a matter of practice.

Build your projects. Show them to your friends. Build projects for your friends.

Build your network. Help the people you meet along the way. What goes around comes around. You'll get what's coming to you.

It is not too late. Life is long.

You will look back on this moment years from now and be glad you made a move.

Plan for it to take a long time. Plan for uncertainty.

But above all, keep coming back to the keyboard. Keep making it out to events. Keep sharing your wins with friends.

As Lao Tsu, the Old Master, once said:

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."
By finishing this book, you've already taken a step. Heck, you may have already taken many steps toward your goals.

Momentum is everything. So keep up that forward momentum you've already built up over these past few hours with this book.

Start coding your next project today.

And always remember:

You can do this.
