- When you hear about web3, you'll notice that cryptocurrency is often part of the conversation. This is because cryptocurrency plays a big role in many of these protocols. It provides a financial incentive (tokens) for anyone who wants to participate in creating, governing, contributing to, or improving one of the projects themselves.

- Tokens also introduce a native payment layer that is completely borderless and frictionless. Companies like Stripe and Paypal have created billions of dollars of value in enabling electronic payments.

- Crypto wallets like MetaMask and Torus enable you to integrate easy, anonymous, and secure international payments and transactions into web3 applications.

- Networks like solana offer several hundred digit millisecond latency and transaction costs of a small fraction of a penny. Unlike the current financial system, users do not have to go through the traditional numerous, friction-filled steps to interact with and participate in the network. All they need to do is download or install a wallet, and they can start sending and receiving payments without any gate-keeping.

- Tokens also brings about the idea of tokenization and the realization of a token economy.

- Imagine, instead, that a new and exciting project is announced that solves a real problem. Anyone can participate in building it or investing in it from day one. The company announces the release of x number of tokens, and give 10% to the early builders, put 10% for sale to the public, and set the rest aside for future payment of contributors and funding of the project.

** DAOs

- DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), which offer an alternative way to build what we traditionally thought of as a company, are gaining tremendous momentum and investment from both traditional developers and venture capital firms.

- These types of organizations are tokenized and turn the idea of organizational structure on its head, offering real, liquid, and equitable ownership to larger portions of stakeholders and aligning incentives in new and interesting ways.

- For example, Friends with Benefits is a DAO of web3 builders and artists, is about a year old, has a market cap of around $125 million as of this writing, and recently received a $10 million round of investment from a16z.


** Identity

- In web3, Identity also works much differently than what we are used to today. Most of the time in web3 apps, identities will be tied to the wallet address of the user interacting with the application.

- Unlike web2 authentication methods like OAuth or email + password (that almost always require users to hand over sensitive and personal information), wallet addresses are completely anonymous unless the user decides to tie their own identity to it publicly.

- If the user chooses to use the same wallet across multiple dapps, their identity is also seamlessly transferable across apps, which lets them build up their reputation over time.

- Protocols and tools like Ceramic and IDX already allow developers to build self-sovereign identity into their applications to replace traditional authentication and identity layers. The Ethereum foundation also has a working RFP for defining a specification for "Sign in with Ethereum" which would help provide a more streamlined and documented way to do this going forward. This is also a good thread that outlines some of the ways that this would enhance traditional authentication flows.


* How to Build on Web3

- I'm a developer who recently transitioned into the web3 space from a traditional development background. So I wanted to start building to get a sense of what the development experience felt like. And I wanted to get an understanding of the types of apps that we can build today.

- I dove right in and decided to document some of the things I was doing in a couple of blog posts.

* Absolute fucking gems 

One example is the app Radicle [https://radicle.xyz/blog/introducing-rad.html] (a decentralized GitHub alternative) which allows stakeholders to participate in the governance of their project. 
- Gitcoin [https://gitcoin.co/]  is another that allows developers to get paid in cryptocurrency for jumping in and working on Open Source issues.
- Yearn [https://docs.yearn.finance/faq#governance] allows stakeholders to participate in decision making and voting on proposals. 
- Uniswap [https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/], 
- SuperRare [https://superrare.com/rare], 
- The Graph [https://thegraph.com/blog/the-graph-grt-token-economics], 
- Audius [https://audius.co/], and countless other protocols and projects have issued tokens as a way to enable ownership, participation, and governance.
- Friends with Benefits [https://www.fwb.help/] is a DAO of web3 builders and artists, is about a year old, has a market cap of around $125 million as of this writing, and recently received a $10 million round of investment from a16z.
